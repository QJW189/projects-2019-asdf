# Modelproject

In our modelproject we examine the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. The CIR model examines interest rates and bond prices. In the CIR model we look at a theoretical bond price and simulated bond price. 
We simulate the CIR model and examine the results. We then extend the model with a Milstein scheme which will increase the rate of convergence. 
#dependencies: The code might take a few minutes to run when making the simulations.
